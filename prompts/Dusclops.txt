# Dusclops Implementation

Implement this card using the **Unified Ability Schema** and **Stack Architecture** (when applicable).

## Architecture Overview

### Unified Ability Schema
Every attack/ability is registered under its exact name with a `category` field:
- **attack**: Deals damage, has energy cost, generates actions
- **activatable**: Player-triggered ability, generates actions
- **modifier**: Continuously modifies values (retreat cost, damage, HP)
- **guard**: Blocks effects/conditions (status, damage, trainer cards)
- **hook**: Event-triggered (on_play, on_knockout, etc.)

### Multi-Effect Abilities
When an ability has multiple effects, use suffixed entries:
```python
"Ability Name (Modifier)": {"category": "modifier", ...},
"Ability Name (Guard)": {"category": "guard", ...},
```

### Stack Architecture (for multi-step effects)
Use when effects require sequential decisions or costs:
- **SearchDeckStep**: Search deck for cards matching filter criteria
- **SelectFromZoneStep**: Select cards from hand/bench/board with filters
- Push steps onto `state.push_step(step)` - they resolve in LIFO order
- Use `on_complete_callback` for chaining steps

### Registry Structure
- **Pokemon Attacks/Abilities:** Use the exact name as the dictionary key.
- **Trainers:** Use `"Play CardName": {"category": "activatable", ...}`.

**Card IDs:** sv6pt5-19, sv6pt5-69, sv8pt5-36 | **Type:** Pokemon (Stage 1) | **HP:** 90

### Feature: Cursed Blast (ACTION)
_Once during your turn, you may put 5 damage counters on 1 of your opponent's Pokemon. If you use this Ability, this Pokemon is Knocked Out._

- Implement `dusclops_cursed_blast_actions(state, card, player)` (Generator)
- Implement `dusclops_cursed_blast_effect(state, card, action)` (Effect)
  - **Requirement:** Check usage flags for Once Per Turn.

**Stack Architecture Required** (Pattern: `SELECT_TARGET`)
The effect function should push resolution steps onto the stack:
```python
def effect(state, card, action):
    from models import SearchDeckStep, SelectFromZoneStep, ZoneType, SelectionPurpose
    # Push steps in reverse order (LIFO)
    # SelectFromZoneStep (target selection)
    state.push_step(step)
    return state
```
Resolution Steps:
  - `SelectFromZoneStep (target selection)`

### Attack: Will-O-Wisp [PP] 50
- Implement `dusclops_will_o_wisp_actions` and `dusclops_will_o_wisp_effect`.

### Registry (`sv6pt5.py`)
```python
SV6PT5_LOGIC = {
    "sv6pt5-19": {
        "Cursed Blast": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": dusclops_cursed_blast_actions,
            "effect": dusclops_cursed_blast_effect,
        },
        "Will-O-Wisp": {
            "category": "attack",
            "generator": dusclops_will_o_wisp_actions,
            "effect": dusclops_will_o_wisp_effect,
        },
    },
    "sv6pt5-69": {
        "Cursed Blast": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": dusclops_cursed_blast_actions,
            "effect": dusclops_cursed_blast_effect,
        },
        "Will-O-Wisp": {
            "category": "attack",
            "generator": dusclops_will_o_wisp_actions,
            "effect": dusclops_will_o_wisp_effect,
        },
    },
}
