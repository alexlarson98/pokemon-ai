# Ultra Ball Implementation

Implement this card using the **Unified Ability Schema** and **Stack Architecture** (when applicable).

## Architecture Overview

### Unified Ability Schema
Every attack/ability is registered under its exact name with a `category` field:
- **attack**: Deals damage, has energy cost, generates actions
- **activatable**: Player-triggered ability, generates actions
- **passive**: Conditional continuous effect ("as long as...", "while...") - checked by engine
- **modifier**: Continuously modifies values (retreat cost, damage, HP)
- **guard**: Blocks effects/conditions (status, damage, trainer cards)
- **hook**: Event-triggered (on_play, on_knockout, etc.)

### Multi-Effect Abilities
When an ability has multiple effects, use suffixed entries:
```python
"Ability Name (Passive)": {"category": "passive", ...},
"Ability Name (Modifier)": {"category": "modifier", ...},
"Ability Name (Guard)": {"category": "guard", ...},
```

### Stack Architecture (for multi-step effects)
Use when effects require sequential decisions or costs:
- **SearchDeckStep**: Search deck for cards matching filter criteria
- **SelectFromZoneStep**: Select cards from hand/bench/board with filters
- Push steps onto `state.push_step(step)` - they resolve in LIFO order
- Use `on_complete_callback` for chaining steps

### Registry Structure
- **Pokemon Attacks/Abilities:** Use the exact name as the dictionary key.
- **Trainers:** Use `"Play CardName": {"category": "activatable", ...}`.

## Version 1

**Card IDs:** sv1-196 | **Type:** Trainer (Item) | **HP:** N/A

### Feature: play (ACTION)
_You can use this card only if you discard 2 other cards from your hand. Search your deck for a Pokemon, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then, shuffle your deck. You may play any number of Item cards during your turn._

- Implement `ultra_ball_actions(state, card, player)` (Generator)
- Implement `ultra_ball_effect(state, card, action)` (Effect)

**Stack Architecture Required** (Pattern: `SEARCH_DECK`)
The effect function should push resolution steps onto the stack:
```python
def effect(state, card, action):
    from models import SearchDeckStep, SelectFromZoneStep, ZoneType, SelectionPurpose
    # Push steps in reverse order (LIFO)
    # shuffle_after=True
    # SearchDeckStep
    # SelectFromZoneStep (DISCARD_COST)
    state.push_step(step)
    return state
```
Resolution Steps:
  - `SelectFromZoneStep (DISCARD_COST)`
  - `SearchDeckStep`
  - `shuffle_after=True`

### Registry (`sv1.py`)
```python
SV1_LOGIC = {
    "sv1-196": {
        "Play Ultra Ball": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": ultra_ball_actions,
            "effect": ultra_ball_effect,
        },
    },
}
```

## Version 2

**Card IDs:** sv4pt5-91 | **Type:** Trainer (Item) | **HP:** N/A

### Feature: play (ACTION)
_You can use this card only if you discard 2 other cards from your hand. Search your deck for a Pokemon, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then, shuffle your deck. You may play any number of Item cards during your turn._

- Implement `ultra_ball_actions(state, card, player)` (Generator)
- Implement `ultra_ball_effect(state, card, action)` (Effect)

**Stack Architecture Required** (Pattern: `SEARCH_DECK`)
The effect function should push resolution steps onto the stack:
```python
def effect(state, card, action):
    from models import SearchDeckStep, SelectFromZoneStep, ZoneType, SelectionPurpose
    # Push steps in reverse order (LIFO)
    # shuffle_after=True
    # SearchDeckStep
    # SelectFromZoneStep (DISCARD_COST)
    state.push_step(step)
    return state
```
Resolution Steps:
  - `SelectFromZoneStep (DISCARD_COST)`
  - `SearchDeckStep`
  - `shuffle_after=True`

### Registry (`sv4pt5.py`)
```python
SV4PT5_LOGIC = {
    "sv4pt5-91": {
        "Play Ultra Ball": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": ultra_ball_actions,
            "effect": ultra_ball_effect,
        },
    },
}
```

## Version 3

**Card IDs:** me1-131 | **Type:** Trainer (Item) | **HP:** N/A

### Feature: play (ACTION)
_You can use this card only if you discard 2 other cards from your hand.  Search your deck for a Pokemon, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then, shuffle your deck. You may play any number of Item cards during your turn._

- Implement `ultra_ball_actions(state, card, player)` (Generator)
- Implement `ultra_ball_effect(state, card, action)` (Effect)

**Stack Architecture Required** (Pattern: `SEARCH_DECK`)
The effect function should push resolution steps onto the stack:
```python
def effect(state, card, action):
    from models import SearchDeckStep, SelectFromZoneStep, ZoneType, SelectionPurpose

    # shuffle_after=True
    # SearchDeckStep
    # SelectFromZoneStep (DISCARD_COST)
    state.push_step(step)
    return state
```
Resolution Steps:
  - `SelectFromZoneStep (DISCARD_COST)`
  - `SearchDeckStep`
  - `shuffle_after=True`

### Registry (`me1.py`)
```python
ME1_LOGIC = {
    "me1-131": {
        "Play Ultra Ball": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": ultra_ball_actions,

        },
    },
