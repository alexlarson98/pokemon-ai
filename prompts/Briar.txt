# Briar Implementation

Implement this card using the **Unified Ability Schema** and **Stack Architecture** (when applicable).

## Architecture Overview

### Unified Ability Schema
Every attack/ability is registered under its exact name with a `category` field:
- **attack**: Deals damage, has energy cost, generates actions
- **activatable**: Player-triggered ability, generates actions
- **passive**: Conditional continuous effect ("as long as...", "while...") - checked by engine
- **modifier**: Continuously modifies values (retreat cost, damage, HP)
- **guard**: Blocks effects/conditions (status, damage, trainer cards)
- **hook**: Event-triggered (on_play, on_knockout, etc.)

### Multi-Effect Abilities
When an ability has multiple effects, use suffixed entries:
```python
"Ability Name (Passive)": {"category": "passive", ...},
"Ability Name (Modifier)": {"category": "modifier", ...},
"Ability Name (Guard)": {"category": "guard", ...},
```

### Stack Architecture (for multi-step effects)
Use when effects require sequential decisions or costs:
- **SearchDeckStep**: Search deck for cards matching filter criteria
- **SelectFromZoneStep**: Select cards from hand/bench/board with filters
- Push steps onto `state.push_step(step)` - they resolve in LIFO order
- Use `on_complete_callback` for chaining steps

### Registry Structure
- **Pokemon Attacks/Abilities:** Use the exact name as the dictionary key.
- **Trainers:** Use `"Play CardName": {"category": "activatable", ...}`.

**Card IDs:** sv7-132, sv7-163, sv7-171, sv8pt5-100 | **Type:** Trainer (Supporter) | **HP:** N/A

### Feature: play (ACTION)
_You can use this card only if your opponent has exactly 2 Prize cards remaining.    During this turn, if your opponent's Active Pokemon is Knocked Out by damage from an attack used by your Tera Pokemon, take 1 more Prize card. You may play only 1 Supporter card during your turn._

- Implement `briar_actions(state, card, player)` (Generator)
- Implement `briar_effect(state, card, action)` (Effect)

### Registry (`sv7.py`)
```python
SV7_LOGIC = {
    "sv7-132": {
        "Play Briar": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": briar_actions,
            "effect": briar_effect,
        },
    },
    "sv7-163": {
        "Play Briar": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": briar_actions,
            "effect": briar_effect,
        },
    },
    "sv7-171": {
        "Play Briar": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": briar_actions,
            "effect": briar_effect,
        },
    },
}
```
