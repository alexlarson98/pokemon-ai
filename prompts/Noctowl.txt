# Noctowl Implementation

Implement this card using the **Unified Ability Schema** and **Stack Architecture** (when applicable).

## Architecture Overview

### Unified Ability Schema
Every attack/ability is registered under its exact name with a `category` field:
- **attack**: Deals damage, has energy cost, generates actions
- **activatable**: Player-triggered ability, generates actions
- **modifier**: Continuously modifies values (retreat cost, damage, HP)
- **guard**: Blocks effects/conditions (status, damage, trainer cards)
- **hook**: Event-triggered (on_play, on_knockout, etc.)

### Multi-Effect Abilities
When an ability has multiple effects, use suffixed entries:
```python
"Ability Name (Modifier)": {"category": "modifier", ...},
"Ability Name (Guard)": {"category": "guard", ...},
```

### Stack Architecture (for multi-step effects)
Use when effects require sequential decisions or costs:
- **SearchDeckStep**: Search deck for cards matching filter criteria
- **SelectFromZoneStep**: Select cards from hand/bench/board with filters
- Push steps onto `state.push_step(step)` - they resolve in LIFO order
- Use `on_complete_callback` for chaining steps

### Registry Structure
- **Pokemon Attacks/Abilities:** Use the exact name as the dictionary key.
- **Trainers:** Use `"Play CardName": {"category": "activatable", ...}`.

## Version 1

**Card IDs:** svp-141, sv7-115, sv8pt5-78 | **Type:** Pokemon (Stage 1) | **HP:** 100

### Feature: Jewel Seeker (HOOK)
_Once during your turn, when you play this Pokemon from your hand to evolve 1 of your Pokemon, if you have any Tera Pokemon in play, you may search your deck for up to 2 Trainer cards, reveal them, and put them into your hand. Then, shuffle your deck._

- Implement `noctowl_jewel_seeker_hook(state, card, context)`

**Stack Architecture Required** (Pattern: `SEARCH_DECK`)
Resolution Steps:
  - `SearchDeckStep`
  - `shuffle_after=True`
  - `SelectFromZoneStep (target selection)`

### Attack: Speed Wing [CC] 60
- Implement `noctowl_speed_wing_actions` and `noctowl_speed_wing_effect`.

### Registry (`svp.py`)
```python
SVP_LOGIC = {
    "svp-141": {
        "Jewel Seeker": {
            "category": "hook",
            "trigger": "on_play",
            "effect": noctowl_jewel_seeker_hook,
        },
        "Speed Wing": {
            "category": "attack",
            "generator": noctowl_speed_wing_actions,
            "effect": noctowl_speed_wing_effect,
        },
    },
}
```

**Reprints:**

### Registry (`sv7.py`)
```python
from cards.sets.svp import (
    noctowl_jewel_seeker_hook,
    noctowl_speed_wing_actions,
    noctowl_speed_wing_effect,
)

SV7_LOGIC = {
    "sv7-115": {
        "Jewel Seeker": {
            "category": "hook",
            "trigger": "on_play",
            "effect": noctowl_jewel_seeker_hook,
        },

            "category": "attack",
            "generator": noctowl_speed_wing_actions,
            "effect": noctowl_speed_wing_effect,
        },
    },
}
```

### Registry (`sv8pt5.py`)
```python
from cards.sets.svp import (
    noctowl_jewel_seeker_hook,
    noctowl_speed_wing_actions,
    noctowl_speed_wing_effect,
)

SV8PT5_LOGIC = {
    "sv8pt5-78": {
        "Jewel Seeker": {
            "category": "hook",
            "trigger": "on_play",
            "effect": noctowl_jewel_seeker_hook,
        },
        "Speed Wing": {
            "category": "attack",
            "generator": noctowl_speed_wing_actions,
            "effect": noctowl_speed_wing_effect,
        },
    },
}
```

## Version 2

**Card IDs:** sv5-127 | **Type:** Pokemon (Stage 1) | **HP:** 110

### Attack: Talon Hunt [CC] 70
_You may search your deck for up to 2 cards and put them into your hand. Then, shuffle your deck._
- Implement `noctowl_talon_hunt_actions` and `noctowl_talon_hunt_effect`.

**Stack Architecture Required** (Pattern: `SEARCH_DECK`)
Resolution Steps:
  - `SearchDeckStep`
  - `shuffle_after=True`

### Registry (`sv5.py`)
```python
SV5_LOGIC = {
    "sv5-127": {
        "Talon Hunt": {
            "category": "attack",
            "generator": noctowl_talon_hunt_actions,
            "effect": noctowl_talon_hunt_effect,
        },
    },
