# Super Rod Implementation

Implement this card using the **Unified Ability Schema** and **Stack Architecture** (when applicable).

## Architecture Overview

### Unified Ability Schema
Every attack/ability is registered under its exact name with a `category` field:
- **attack**: Deals damage, has energy cost, generates actions
- **activatable**: Player-triggered ability, generates actions
- **passive**: Conditional continuous effect ("as long as...", "while...") - checked by engine
- **modifier**: Continuously modifies values (retreat cost, damage, HP)
- **guard**: Blocks effects/conditions (status, damage, trainer cards)
- **hook**: Event-triggered (on_play, on_knockout, etc.)

### Multi-Effect Abilities
When an ability has multiple effects, use suffixed entries:
```python
"Ability Name (Passive)": {"category": "passive", ...},
"Ability Name (Modifier)": {"category": "modifier", ...},
"Ability Name (Guard)": {"category": "guard", ...},
```

### Stack Architecture (for multi-step effects)
Use when effects require sequential decisions or costs:
- **SearchDeckStep**: Search deck for cards matching filter criteria
- **SelectFromZoneStep**: Select cards from hand/bench/board with filters
- Push steps onto `state.push_step(step)` - they resolve in LIFO order
- Use `on_complete_callback` for chaining steps

### Registry Structure
- **Pokemon Attacks/Abilities:** Use the exact name as the dictionary key.
- **Trainers:** Use `"Play CardName": {"category": "activatable", ...}`.

**Card IDs:** sv2-188, sv2-276 | **Type:** Trainer (Item) | **HP:** N/A

### Feature: play (ACTION)
_Shuffle up to 3 in any combination of Pokemon and Basic Energy cards from your discard pile into your deck. You may play any number of Item cards during your turn._

- Implement `super_rod_actions(state, card, player)` (Generator)
- Implement `super_rod_effect(state, card, action)` (Effect)

**Stack Architecture Required** (Pattern: `SELECT_FROM_DISCARD`)
The effect function should push resolution steps onto the stack:
```python
def effect(state, card, action):
    from models import SearchDeckStep, SelectFromZoneStep, ZoneType, SelectionPurpose
    # Push steps in reverse order (LIFO)
    # shuffle_selected_into_deck=True
    # SelectFromZoneStep (zone=ZoneType.DISCARD)
    state.push_step(step)
    return state
```
Resolution Steps:
  - `SelectFromZoneStep (zone=ZoneType.DISCARD)`
  - `shuffle_selected_into_deck=True`

### Registry (`sv2.py`)
```python
SV2_LOGIC = {
    "sv2-188": {
        "Play Super Rod": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": super_rod_actions,
            "effect": super_rod_effect,
        },
    },
    "sv2-276": {
        "Play Super Rod": {
            "category": "activatable",
            "generator": super_rod_actions,
            "effect": super_rod_effect,
        },
    },
}
```
